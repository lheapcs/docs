# Airtable custom objects

The Airtable connector uses Cyclr custom objects to make methods dynamic based on module names. Each custom object name requires:

-   [The Base ID](#find-the-base-id) of the Table that you want to work with.
-   [The Table Name](#find-the-table-name) of the you want to interact with.
    Note: Base ID's and Table Names can be different for each client account.

## Set up a custom object

When you set up a custom object it creates a new method category with the parameters you enter. To set up a custom object:

1. Go to the Airtable connector **Settings** page:
    - For template connectors: **Cyclr Console** > **Templates** > **Template Connectors** > **Airtable** > **Edit Connector**.
    - For connectors within a cycle: **Cycle Builder** > **Application Connectors** > **Airtable** > **Settings**.
2. Under the **Methods and Fields** heading, expand the **Records (Custom Object)** category.
3. Select the red **Copy this Category to create a Custom Object Category** icon.
4. Enter the BaseID, followed by a dot, and then the Table Name into **Specify object name**. For example, appTCumMdMOC1Zcqz.TestTable .
5. Select **Copy**.

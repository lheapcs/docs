1. Log into the JobProgress frontend as an administrative user.
2. Locate the JobProgress developer  settings
3. Navigate to the **Settings** area for the logged in account. In this section, you will find an area for **Developers**.
4. In the **Developer** area, click on the **Generate Token** button. This will create a new `Access Token` with the given name. Save this token for later use.

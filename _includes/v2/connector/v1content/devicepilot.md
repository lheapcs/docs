## Webhooks

<div class="section-content" markdown="1">

Webhooks are managed by DevicePilot, so will need to be setup through the admin portal. To do this:

1. Add the webhook method that is present in the connector. Enter *Step setup* and note the webhook URL. It should look similar to *https://my.cyclr.com/api/webhook/ABC123* depending on your region.
2. Navigate to the [connections](https://app.devicepilot.com/#/connect/manage) area  in DevicePilot.
3. Create a new webhook by clicking *Get Started* underneath the *Webhooks* category.
4. Enter in the appropriate details.
    1. Set URL to the Cyclr webhook URL (see step 1).
    2. Set Method to *POST*.
    3. Headers should contain *Authorization* which is set to the `API key` entered in during connector setup, and *content-type* is set to *application/json*.
    4. Body represents the response and data.
5. The webhook setup should look similar to the following:
